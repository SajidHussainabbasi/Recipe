# Development Strategy

A clear plan to guide the development of the **Recipe** web application from start to finish.

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup
- Define core features and finalize API choice (e.g., TheMealDB).
- Create a modular folder structure (`api/`, `components/`, `handlers/`, `listeners/`).
- Set up a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript environment (no frameworks).

## Phase 2: Core Functionality
- Implement recipe search functionality using user input.
- Fetch data using `async/await` from the public API.
- Display key recipe details: name, category, cuisine, instructions, and image.
- Handle no-result scenarios gracefully.

## Phase 3: UI & Responsiveness
- Build a clean and centered UI layout.
- Apply CSS for consistent styling and responsive design across devices.
- Add fallback images for missing thumbnails.

## Phase 4: Enhancements (Nice-to-Haves)
- Show multiple recipes in grid/list format.
- Implement loading spinner or status message during API calls.
- Add recent search history with `localStorage`.
- Enable random recipe feature.
- Add dark/light theme toggle and accessibility improvements.

## Phase 5: Testing & Debugging
- Test all features across multiple devices and browsers.
- Verify edge cases (e.g., empty input, API failure, broken image links).
- Fix UI glitches or code inconsistencies.
