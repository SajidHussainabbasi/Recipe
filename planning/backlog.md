### Must-Have
- [x] Set up project structure with modular folders (`api`, `components`, `handlers`, `listeners`)
- [x] Fetch recipe data from a public API (e.g., `https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s={recipeName}`)
- [x] Create input field to search recipes by name
- [x] Trigger search using both a button click and the "Enter" key
- [x] Display core recipe details: name, category, area (cuisine), instructions, and image
- [x] Show a message when no recipes are found
- [x] Use async/await for all API calls
- [x] Design responsive and mobile-friendly layout
- [x] Add fallback image when recipe image is unavailable
- [x] Style UI with clean, readable, and centered layout using CSS
