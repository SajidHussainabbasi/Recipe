# Recipe

> The **Recipe** project allows users to search for recipes by name using the [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php). When a user enters a recipe name, the app fetches and displays key details such as the dish's image, name, category, cuisine (area), and preparation instructions. This is a simple and interactive way to explore meals from around the world.
